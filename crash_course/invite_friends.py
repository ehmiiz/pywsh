# My implementation of the list exercise where
# a invite list is created and manipulated.
# The program should define a list, invite members
# Have a member bail out, replace that member
# Add 3 new members in the start, middle and end of the list
# Finally remove everyone but two members



# Define list
invite_list = ['freppe söderberg', 'ludde jeansson', 'björn strid', 'lex fridman', 'jeffrey snover', 'ricky gervais']

# New member

# Append a member to last element of list
