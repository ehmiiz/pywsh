"""
functions:
you can import a function using the import keyword
however, how does the import keyword work locally?
1. you can import directly if the .py files (both function and the
import file) are placed in the same folder
2. from your new program (not the function) you can import sys and append 
the syspath of the function:
sys.path.append('/home/ehmiiz/git/pywsh/crash_course')
